## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The creative design of the environment and character spritesheets were really fun to create. It was a rewarding experience to see the art bring the game's concept to life.
- **Sound Design:** The background music and sound effects really helped set the mood. It felt like the right vibe for the game, giving it a bit more life and atmosphere as you explored the room

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** I wanted to create more levels but that wasn’t possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Collision Detection:** Perfecting collision detection for objects and the player was a challenge. I spent a lot of time debugging.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Debugging:** Through trial-and-error and breaking things down step-by-step, I learned the importance of not rushing the debugging process and tackling issues one at a time.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on the main mechanics and the key experience really helped keep the game polished.
