# 13.01
  Today I started with the platform template and changed it to match my game idea. Then I started with the basic player movement. 
# 14.01 
  Today I continued with the player movement and added the control that the player can push certain objects. 
  So if the player holds down the key "e" while moving with "a" or "d", he is able to push certain objects.
# 15.01 
  Today I made the start overlay menu and the exit button. So you can exit the game and start again.; 
  Then I started with the control, when the player collides with the paper snippet he finishes the level and the game is over. 
# 16.01
  Today I worked on the 3 lives with hearts implementation. The concept is when the player collides with a certain object (the Kaktus), he dies and starts from the start position again. 
  Afterwards I started with the art part, first I worked on the background and I also changed the canvas size. 
# 17.01
  Today I first implemented the background in the game and then I worked on the art of the individual platforms. Because every Platform in my game is different. 
  Afterwards I implemented it in the code. Then I began to work on my character sprites. 
# 20.01 
  Today I worked again on the sprites of my game. I made a walking, jumping and idle character animation. Then I worked on the Paper roll animation and implemented it in the code. 
# 21.01 
  Today I worked again a bit on the sprites and finished implementing everything in the code and then I worked on the starting screen art the buttons art and also the ending screen pop up art.
