  Today I started with the platform template and changed it to match my game idea. Then I started with the basic player movement.

  Today I continued with the player movement and added the control that the player can push certain objects. 
  So if the player holds down the key "e" while moving with "a" or "d", he is able to push certain objects.

  Today I made the start overlay menu and the exit button. So you can exit the game and start again.; 
  Then I started with the control, when the player collides with the paper snippet he finishes the level and the game is over.
